👋 Hey there! I'm @vTg2208

👀 About Me:
- I’m deeply interested in solving problems, writing clean code, and the occasional debugging adventures (read: staring at the screen for hours).
- Passionate about technology, algorithms, and making things that just work (™).
- 
🌱 Currently Learning:
- Flutter – bringing my ideas to life on screens of all sizes.
- Data Structures and Algorithms – because why not over-optimize everything?
- Dipping my toes into Haskell—it's fun… when it works!
  
💞️ Looking to Collaborate On:
- Anything that involves code, creativity, and a sprinkle of madness.
- Open-source projects that make a difference, because teamwork makes the dream work!
  
📫 How to Reach Me:
- Shoot me a message here or catch me at: [theegelavishnuvardhan22@gmail.com].
- Fun fact: I’m likely to respond faster to code reviews than to texts. 😅
- 
😄 Pronouns:
- Code Wizard (Just kidding: He/Him)

⚡ Fun Fact:
- I once fixed a bug at 3 a.m. and forgot how I did it by sunrise.
- My 5km run PR is faster than my debugging sessions! 🏃‍♂️💨
